		<p>This traditional Filipino dish is different from the Mexican Menudo. The Mexican version is soup-based, it is not a stew. They also use tripe and chilies as their main ingredient while our version uses sliced pork meat and liver. Common vegetables like potatoes, bell pepper, and carrots are used. Sometimes green peas and raisins And of course, let's not forget - the hotdog!</p>
		<p>It is one of the most common dishes you will see served when feeding a large crowd. It's a favored dish on Fiestas, celebrations, and family gatherings! It is also ever-present on menus of carinderias (budget-friendly eateries). The reasons behind it are simple.</p>
