					Paksiw is a term associated to a dish that is cooked with vinegar and garlic. Lechon Paksiw is a Filipino pork dish made from leftover roast pig which is known as “Lechon”. Aside from using roast pig, leftover Lechon kawali can also be used.Making this dish is a practical way to recycle leftover pork. Instead of reheating the same dish over and over, making paksiw out of it makes the pork more flavorful bringing more life to the ingredient.

				<p>
					This traditional Filipino dish is different from the Mexican Menudo. The Mexican version is soup-based, it is not a stew. They also use tripe and chilies as their main ingredient while our version uses sliced pork meat and liver. Common vegetables like potatoes, bell pepper, and carrots are used. Sometimes green peas and raisins And of course, let's not forget - the hotdog!
				</p>
				<p>
					It is one of the most common dishes you will see served when feeding a large crowd. It's a favored dish on Fiestas, celebrations, and family gatherings! It is also ever-present on menus of carinderias (budget-friendly eateries). The reasons behind it are simple.

				<p>
					The word Adobo was derived from the Spanish word “adobar”. It means to marinate. This can be in the form of a liquid marinade or to rub using a combination of powdered ingredient.This version of Filipino Adobo suggests marinating the pork in soy sauce and crushed garlic. By preference, vinegar can also be added as a marinade ingredient.
				</p>
				<p>
					Mexican adobo, on the other hand, makes use of chillies, garlic, cinnamon, and oregano as marinade. Both dishes look and taste different. It will be unfair to compare which among the two dishes are best because each of us has our own preference when it comes to flavor.
